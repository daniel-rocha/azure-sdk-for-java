     * <p>The Data Upload API allows the caller to upload data content to the Azure Maps service. You can use this API
     * in a scenario like uploading a collection of Geofences in `GeoJSON` format, for use in our [Azure Maps Geofencing
     * Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/spatial).
     *
     * <p>## Submit Upload Request
     *
     * <p>To upload your content you will use a `POST` request. The request body will contain the data to upload. The
     * `dataFormat` query parameter will contain the format for the data, the `dataSharingLevel` query parameter can
     * contain the sharing level for the data. The `Content-Type` header will be set to the content type of the data.
     *
     * <p>For example, to upload a collection of geofences in `GeoJSON` format, set the request body to the geofence
     * content. Set the `dataFormat` query parameter to _geojson_, and set the `Content-Type` header to either one of
     * the following media types:
     *
     * <p>- `application/json` - `application/vnd.geo+json` - `application/octet-stream`
     *
     * <p>Here's a sample request body for uploading a simple Geofence represented as a circle geometry using a center
     * point and a radius. The sample below is in `GeoJSON`:
     *
     * <p>```json { "type": "FeatureCollection", "features": [{ "type": "Feature", "geometry": { "type": "Point",
     * "coordinates": [-122.126986, 47.639754] }, "properties": { "geometryId": "001", "radius": 500 } }] } ```
     *
     * <p>The Data Upload API performs a [long-running request](https://aka.ms/am-creator-lrt-v2).
     *
     * <p>## Data Upload Limits
     *
     * <p>Please, be aware that currently every Azure Maps account has a [data storage
     * limit](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/azure-subscription-service-limits#azure-maps-limits).
     * Once the storage limit is reached, all the new upload API calls will return a `409 Conflict` http error response.
     * You can always use the [Data Delete API](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/data%20v2/deletepreview) to
     * delete old/unused content and create space for new uploads.
     *
     * @param uploadDataFormat Data format of the content being uploaded.
     * @param uploadContent The content to upload.
     * @param contentLength The contentLength parameter.
     * @param uploadDataDescription The description to be given to the upload.
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException thrown if parameters fail the validation.
     * @throws ManagementException thrown if the request is rejected by server.
     * @throws RuntimeException all other wrapped checked exceptions if the request fails to be sent.
     * @return the response model for a Long-Running Operations API.

     *
     * <p>## Submit Upload Request

     * `dataFormat` query parameter will contain the format for the data, the `dataSharingLevel` query parameter can
     * contain the sharing level for the data. The `Content-Type` header will be set to the content type of the data.
     *
     * <p>For example, to upload a collection of geofences in `GeoJSON` format, set the request body to the geofence
     * content. Set the `dataFormat` query parameter to _geojson_, and set the `Content-Type` header to either one of
     * the following media types:
     *
     * <p>- `application/json` - `application/vnd.geo+json` - `application/octet-stream`

     * <p>The Data Update API allows the caller to update a previously uploaded data content.
     *
     * <p>You can use this API in a scenario like adding or removing geofences to or from an existing collection of
     * geofences. Geofences are uploaded using the [Data Upload
     * API](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/data%20v2/uploadpreview), for use in the [Azure Maps Geofencing
     * Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/spatial).
     *
     * <p>Please note that the Update API will *replace* and *override* the existing data content.
     *
     * <p>## Submit Update Request
     *
     * <p>To update your content you will use a `PUT` request. The request body will contain the new data that will
     * replace the existing data. The `Content-Type` header will be set to the content type of the data, and the path
     * will contain the `udid` of the data to be update.
     *
     * <p>For example, to update a collection of geofences that were previously uploaded using the Upload API, place the
     * new geofence content in the request body. Set the `udid` parameter in the path to the `udid` of the data received
     * previously in the upload API response. And set the `Content-Type` header to one of the following media types:
     *
     * <p>- `application/json` - `application/vnd.geo+json` - `application/octet-stream`
     *
     * <p>Here's a sample request body for updating a simple Geofence. It's represented as a circle geometry using a
     * center point and a radius. The sample below is in `GeoJSON`:
     *
     * <p>```json { "type": "FeatureCollection", "features": [{ "type": "Feature", "geometry": { "type": "Point",
     * "coordinates": [-122.126986, 47.639754] }, "properties": { "geometryId": "001", "radius": 500 } }] } ```
     *
     * <p>The previously uploaded geofence had a radius of 100m. The above request will update it to 500m.
     *
     * <p>The Data Update API performs a [long-running request](https://aka.ms/am-creator-lrt-v2).
     *
     * <p>## Data Update Limits
     *
     * <p>Please, be aware that currently every Azure Maps account has a [data storage
     * limit](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/azure-subscription-service-limits#azure-maps-limits).
     * Once the storage limit is reached, all the new upload API calls will return a `409 Conflict` http error response.
     * You can always use the [Data Delete API](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/data%20v2/deletepreview) to
     * delete old/unused content and create space for new uploads.
     *
     * @param uniqueDataId The unique data id for the content. The `udid` must have been obtained from a successful
     *     [Data Upload API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/maps/data%20v2/uploadpreview) call.
     * @param updateContent The new content that will update/replace the previously uploaded content.

     *
     * <p>The Data Update API allows the caller to update a previously uploaded data content.
     *
     * <p>You can use this API in a scenario like adding or removing geofences to or from an existing collection of
     * geofences. Geofences are uploaded using the [Data Upload
     * API](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/data%20v2/uploadpreview), for use in the [Azure Maps Geofencing
     * Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/spatial).
     *
     * <p>Please note that the Update API will *replace* and *override* the existing data content.
     *
     * <p>## Submit Update Request
     *
     * <p>To update your content you will use a `PUT` request. The request body will contain the new data that will
     * replace the existing data. The `Content-Type` header will be set to the content type of the data, and the path
     * will contain the `udid` of the data to be update.
     *
     * <p>For example, to update a collection of geofences that were previously uploaded using the Upload API, place the
     * new geofence content in the request body. Set the `udid` parameter in the path to the `udid` of the data received
     * previously in the upload API response. And set the `Content-Type` header to one of the following media types:
     *
     * <p>- `application/json` - `application/vnd.geo+json` - `application/octet-stream`
     *
     * <p>Here's a sample request body for updating a simple Geofence. It's represented as a circle geometry using a
     * center point and a radius. The sample below is in `GeoJSON`:
     *
     * <p>```json { "type": "FeatureCollection", "features": [{ "type": "Feature", "geometry": { "type": "Point",
     * "coordinates": [-122.126986, 47.639754] }, "properties": { "geometryId": "001", "radius": 500 } }] } ```
     *
     * <p>The previously uploaded geofence had a radius of 100m. The above request will update it to 500m.
     *
     * <p>The Data Update API performs a [long-running request](https://aka.ms/am-creator-lrt-v2).
     *
     * <p>## Data Update Limits
     *
     * <p>Please, be aware that currently every Azure Maps account has a [data storage
     * limit](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/azure-subscription-service-limits#azure-maps-limits).
     * Once the storage limit is reached, all the new upload API calls will return a `409 Conflict` http error response.
     * You can always use the [Data Delete API](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/data%20v2/deletepreview) to
     * delete old/unused content and create space for new uploads.
     *
     * @param uniqueDataId The unique data id for the content. The `udid` must have been obtained from a successful

     * <p>You can use this API in a scenario like adding or removing geofences to or from an existing collection of
     * geofences. Geofences are uploaded using the [Data Upload
     * API](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/data%20v2/uploadpreview), for use in the [Azure Maps Geofencing
