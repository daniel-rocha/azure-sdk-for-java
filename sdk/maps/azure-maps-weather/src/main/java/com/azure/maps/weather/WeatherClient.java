     * **Get Weather along route**

     *
     * <p>Weather along a route API returns hyper local (one kilometer or less), up-to-the-minute weather nowcasts,
     * weather hazard assessments, and notifications along a route described as a sequence of waypoints. This includes a
     * list of weather hazards affecting the waypoint or route, and the aggregated hazard index for each waypoint might
     * be used to paint each portion of a route according to how safe it is for the driver. When submitting the
     * waypoints, it is recommended to stay within, or close to, the distance that can be traveled within 120-mins or
     * shortly after. Data is updated every five minutes.
     *
     * <p>The service supplements Azure Maps [Route Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/route) that allows
     * you to first request a route between an origin and a destination and use that as an input for Weather Along Route
     * endpoint.
     *
     * <p>In addition, the service supports scenarios to generate weather notifications for waypoints that experience an
     * increase in intensity of a weather hazard. For example, if the vehicle is expected to begin experiencing heavy
     * rain as it reaches a waypoint, a weather notification for heavy rain will be generated for that waypoint allowing
     * the end product to display a heavy rain notification before the driver reaches that waypoint. The trigger for
     * when to display the notification for a waypoint could be based, for example, on a
     * [geofence](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-maps/tutorial-iot-hub-maps), or selectable distance to the
     * waypoint.
     *
     * <p>The API covers all regions of the planet except latitudes above Greenland and Antarctica.

     * @param format Desired format of the response. Only `json` format is supported.
     * @param query Coordinates through which the route is calculated, separated by colon (:) and entered in
     *     chronological order. A minimum of two waypoints is required. A single API call may contain up to 60
     *     waypoints. A waypoint indicates location, ETA, and optional heading: latitude,longitude,ETA,heading, where *
     *     `Latitude` - Latitude coordinate in decimal degrees. * `Longitude` - Longitude coordinate in decimal degrees.
     *     * `ETA (estimated time of arrival)` - The number of minutes from the present time that it will take for the
     *     vehicle to reach the waypoint. Allowed range is from 0.0 to 120.0 minutes. * `Heading` - An optional value
     *     indicating the vehicle heading as it passes the waypoint. Expressed in clockwise degrees relative to true
     *     north. This is issued to calculate sun glare as a driving hazard. Allowed range is from 0.0 to 360.0 degrees.
     *     If not provided, a heading will automatically be derived based on the position of neighboring waypoints.
     *     <p>It is recommended to stay within, or close to, the distance that can be traveled within 120-mins or

     * <p>Get Daily Historical Records service returns climatology data such as past daily record temperatures,

     * Generally, historical data may be available as far back as the last 5 to 40+ years, depending on the location.
     *
     * @param format Desired format of the response. Only `json` format is supported.
     * @param coordinates The applicable query specified as a comma separated string composed by latitude followed by
     *     longitude e.g. "47.641268,-122.125679".
     * @param startDate Start date in ISO 8601 format, for example, 2019-10-27. The date range supported is 1 to 31
     *     calendar days, so be sure to specify a startDate and endDate that does not exceed a maximum of 31 days (i.e.:
     *     startDate=2012-01-01&amp;endDate=2012-01-31).

     *     days, so be sure to specify a startDate and endDate that does not exceed a maximum of 31 days (i.e.:
     *     startDate=2012-01-01&amp;endDate=2012-01-31).
     * @param unit Specifies to return the data in either metric units or imperial units. Default value is metric.
     * @param context The context to associate with this operation.
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException thrown if parameters fail the validation.
     * @throws ErrorResponseException thrown if the request is rejected by server.
     * @throws RuntimeException all other wrapped checked exceptions if the request fails to be sent.
     * @return the response.
